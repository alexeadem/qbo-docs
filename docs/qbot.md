# QBOT
> QBO provides a demo repository with demos that can be deployed in qbo for testing purposes. The demos are deployed using a typing bot. All that is required is to start the bot and tap enter to continue. You'll see all the commands that will be executed as qbot is typing them. Keep in mind that the commands are not simulated but real commands that are just typed for you. The bot's name is `qbot`

#### 1. Get qbot repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexeadem/qbot
cd qbot
```

#### 2. Run demo

```bash
./qbot 
>>> ./qbot {istio | nginx | kubeconfig | nvidia | kubeflow}                 -- Demo to run
```
